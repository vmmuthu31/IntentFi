# IntentFi - Express Intent. Lend Smarter. Borrow Better. Earn More.

![cover323](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a7184004-77ac-4f29-8419-fc45ce012abc)

## 🚀 Overview

Most "AI intent" projects stop at simple swaps or token transfers — acting as surface-level wrappers over existing DeFi tools. **IntentFi goes deeper.** We've built an execution-first, open-intent protocol that automates the most valuable parts of DeFi: **lending, borrowing, and yield strategies** — across chains, without gas, code, or coordination.

IntentFi transforms natural language into real, executable, cross-chain DeFi strategies. Powered by AI, account abstraction, and a modular strategy engine, users can express intents like _"Lend USDC at best APY"_ or _"Borrow ETH if rates drop"_ — and IntentFi handles bridging, routing, optimizing, and deploying, completely gasless and KYC-compliant.

> We don't just interpret your intent — we execute it.

## 🎯 Problem

Despite billions in DeFi TVL, the majority of users are left behind due to:

- Overwhelming complexity
- Fragmented protocols and capital
- Chain-specific UIs and KYC hurdles
- Gas fees and manual bridging

**Existing intent protocols stop at swaps or simulations.** They lack depth, composability, and true execution.

---

## 🧠 Solution: Intent-Driven DeFi Automation

IntentFi allows users to define financial goals in natural language, such as:

- `"Lend USDC at best yield across chains"`
- `"Borrow ETH if interest rate is below 3%"`
- `"Move capital into safer vaults if APY drops"`

Our AI parses the input and builds an **executable DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph)** of DeFi actions like bridging, staking, borrowing, and exiting. All flows are:

- ✅ Gasless via Paymaster + Account Abstraction
- ✅ Compliant via Self Protocol KYC
- ✅ Routed across chains with Hyperlane & CCTP

## 🔧 How It Works

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/300b1518-1211-43b6-851b-068f6888634a)

1. **User Input:** `"Lend USDC at best APY, borrow ETH if rates drop"`
2. **AI Parsing:** Natural language is parsed into a DAG of intent blocks
3. **Strategy Builder:** Flow created with yield/borrow/exit conditions
4. **Execution:** Gasless, cross-chain bridging + protocol interaction
5. **Monitoring:** Auto-yield rebalancing + risk triggers activated

---

## 🔐 Core Features

- **Lending, Borrowing & Yielding via Intent**  
  Users can execute full-stack DeFi strategies by simply stating their goals in plain English. Whether it's lending USDC, borrowing against BTC, or compounding yields — IntentFi handles it all automatically across chains.

- **Visual No-Code Builder**  
  A drag-and-drop UI allows users to design, preview, and customize DeFi strategies without writing a single line of code. This opens up powerful financial tools to non-technical users and institutions alike.

- **Live Strategy Optimization**  
  IntentFi constantly monitors APY, gas prices, and risk factors. It automatically rebalances, exits, or reroutes strategies based on real-time data — ensuring users always get optimal results.

- **One-Time KYC for All Chains**  
  Integrated with Self Protocol, IntentFi enables a single KYC verification that unlocks usage across all supported chains and strategies — ensuring regulatory readiness without repeated friction.

- **Cross-Chain Routing & Fallbacks**  
  Powered by Hyperlane and Circle CCTP, IntentFi bridges, swaps, and deploys capital across multiple chains. With built-in fallback logic, strategies remain robust even if one chain or protocol fails.

## 🌍 Use Cases

| Persona           | Intent Example                               |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| DeFi Explorer     | `Lend my USDC for highest APY across chains` |
| Investor          | `Buy ETH every Friday if RSI < 40`           |
| Portfolio Manager | `Rebalance to 60/40 stable/degen`            |
| DAO Treasury      | `Deploy idle funds with risk score < 3`      |

## 🧩 What Sets Us Apart

- **IntentFi goes beyond swaps — it unlocks DeFi's real power**  
  Most "intent" platforms stop at simple token movements. We go deep — enabling users to lend, borrow, and compound yields across chains with just one sentence.

- **AI that actually executes, not just simulates**  
  Our LLM-powered engine turns natural language into live, executable DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs) — orchestrating real DeFi actions like bridging, lending, vaulting, exiting, and more.

- **Fully gasless, fully compliant — out of the box**  
  Every action is abstracted behind account abstraction and Paymaster tech. One-time KYC via Self Protocol ensures users can launch compliant strategies globally, without breaking flow.

# IntentFi with Model Context Protocol (MCP) Integration

This project demonstrates how to use Intent-based DeFi interactions powered by the GOAT SDK, with the potential to integrate the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for more sophisticated function execution.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`
3. Run the development server with `npm run dev`

## Using Model Context Protocol

The project can be enhanced by integrating the Model Context Protocol (MCP) TypeScript SDK available at [https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk).

### Benefits of Using MCP

- **Automatic Function Execution**: MCP can automatically determine which functions to execute in which order.
- **No Prompt Engineering**: MCP handles this automatically - no need to give instructions in the prompt.
- **Tool-Based Architecture**: Define functions as tools that MCP can leverage.

### Integration Example

Here's how you could integrate MCP with the getPoolInformation function:

```typescript
import { MCP } from "@modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk";

// Define your functions as tools
const tools = {
  getPoolInformation: async (params: {
    chainId: number;
    provider: Web3Provider;
  }) => {
    // Your implementation here
    return pools;
  },
};

// Initialize MCP with your tools
const mcp = new MCP({
  tools,
  model: "gpt-4", // or other supported models
});

// Process user intents with MCP
async function processUserIntent(intent: string) {
  const result = await mcp.run(intent);
  // MCP will automatically:
  // 1. Parse the intent
  // 2. Determine which tools to use
  // 3. Execute the tools in the right order
  // 4. Return the result
  return result;
}
```

## Function Definitions

The IntentFi agent includes several DeFi functions that can be triggered with natural language:

- **getPoolInformation**: Get information about available liquidity pools
  - Triggered by: "get pools", "pool information", "pool details", "pool data", "get liquidity"
- **getPricePrediction**: Get price prediction for a token
- **getTokenInsights**: Get token analysis and insights
- **bridgeTokens**: Bridge tokens between chains
- **resolveEnsName**: Resolve ENS names to addresses
- **addBalancerLiquidity**: Add liquidity to Balancer pools

## Real Blockchain Integration

This project is designed to interact with actual blockchain networks rather than relying on mock data:

- All functions use the connected wallet's provider for real blockchain calls
- The `getPoolInformation` function connects to the network and fetches actual pool data
- MCP integration is designed to work with live blockchain data
- When implementing your own functions, ensure they interact with on-chain data through the provided Web3Provider

## Future Enhancements

- Full MCP integration for all DeFi functions
- Support for more complex, multi-step operations
- Enhanced error handling and recovery strategies
